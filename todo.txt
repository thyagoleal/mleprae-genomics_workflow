# To do

- -Create a recap script that assembles all the recaps in a given directory into one master recap file
- add bowtie2 index auto
- add options to add M. lepromatosis
- add option to not remove bad sites in the phyloprep script
- Read documentation about illumina fastq_illumina_filter and see if it is needed
- figtree (tree visualization)
- Add MEGA to the workflow (input is fasta from phyloprep step)
- Only phyloprep samples that have > 5X coverage (toggle on/off, or different coverage threshold)

MEGA OPTIONS:
- Analyze -> Nucleotide -> MISSING DATA (NA) -> GAP -, IDENTITY . 
- Protein? No -> Phylogeny -> Choose algorithm for tree (default = maximum parsimony) -> 
- MP search method: SPR
- bootstrap replicates: 500
- MEGA can identify the best method
- Gap/Missing data treatment: Partial deletion (80%)
- Max no of trees to retain: 3
- number of threads 4/5
... usually takes hours


- If everything goes well, delete the original data/samples files

# BACKUP 
- Add a backup option inside config and a backup routine
